# Human Activity Recognition using Transformer Models

We implement and train a transformer model to solve a human acivity recognition task. 

Data is available from [here](https://www.timeseriesclassification.com/description.php?Dataset=MotionSenseHAR).

The code is adapted from [this](https://github.com/gzerveas/mvts_transformer) framework, applied to the task of human activity recognition.

Please see my [Medium](https://pub.towardsai.net/time-series-regression-using-transformer-models-a-plain-english-introduction-3215892e1cc) post for more information.
